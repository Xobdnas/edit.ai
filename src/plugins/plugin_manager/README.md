# Plugin manager

Enabled/Disable Plugins view:
 - Need a route to toggle plugins
 - Use the "iphone" type toggle for on/off
 - Allow them to be group in categories or "groups"

We should save the "enabled/disabled" plugin list to something as a "registry", so we don't bother
rebuilding/it/etc caching till we modified the plugin/manager/etc..
