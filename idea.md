## Ideas

- Store ideas in the repo so we can share it
 - should we also have a place of leaving notes?
   - technically github web ui is good enough for a simple idea scribble
   
 - but also makes it so all ideas are written in editor of choice 
  -- Could be bad? A lot of effort to write idea but is it a lot of effort?
 
 - Every folder must have a README.md file (some exceptions or no exceptions) - Probably belonds in standards doc.
