# Core Modules


## Ideas:
 - backend all "required" or make the entire app isophormic which will required a build step
 
 - TypeScript? Value?

 - Webpack vs RollUP (I hate webpack but it has value in numbers (users and plugins))

 - Class inheritence, Seperating "Views" from "Model" & "Controller"
 
 - Server side no "import" allow? or babel it.
 
 - Coding standards
 
 - If we open source from the start we get great tools for free:
   - GitHub
   - TravisCI
   - CodeClimate
   - Coveralls.io
   - Codecov.io
   - Pretty much all these products -> http://shields.io/
   - ^^^^^ Will tremoundously increase productivity
   
 
 - Have some things open source for the tooling
 - Other stuff close source:
   - Hosting Platform
   - GraphQL API
   - API Gateway Stuff
   - AWS Tools Setup
     - Machine Learning Image Matching 
     - AI Tagging
     - Other ML Stuff
